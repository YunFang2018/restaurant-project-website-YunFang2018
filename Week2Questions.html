   a. What is the CSS selector that you would use to select all the code elements? How many are there?<br>
            <img src ="hw2q2a.png" alt = "screenshot of hw2q2a"><br>
   b. What is the CSS selector that you would use to select all the code elements contained in pre elements? How many are there? Are there more or less than above. Why?<br>
            <img src ="hw2q2b.png" alt = "screenshot of hw2q2b"><br>
            The code element represents a fragment of computer code. It could be an XML element name, a file name, a computer program, or any other string that a computer would recognize.<br>
            The pre element represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements.<br>
            That is, all the code elements contained in pre elements is less than all the code elements.<br>
   c. What is the CSS selector that you would use to select all the figure elements? How many are there?<br>
             <img src ="hw2q2c.png" alt = "screenshot of hw2q2c"><br>
   d. What is the CSS selector that you would use to select all the img elements? How many are there? Is this different from the above? Why?<br>
            <img src ="hw2q2d.png" alt = "screenshot of hw2q2d"><br>
            A figure tag is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part without affecting the main flow. A img element embeds an image into the document. It creates a holding space for the referenced image.

            A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a  object-oriented programming interface for HTML documents which represents a document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page so that the web page can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. Different DOM standards are implemented in most modern browsers. Many browsers extend those standards. The web documents may be accessed by various browsers with different DOMs so that it might differ.
